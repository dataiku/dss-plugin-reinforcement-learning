# Reinforcement Learning in DSS

Create agents that learn to interact with environments using Reinforcement Learning.

This plugin provides tools to rapidly train, test and visualize reinforcement learning agents, on different video game environments.

This plugin relies on [Stable Baselines Library](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/). Stable Baselines is an open-source library written in Python. We use it to run Reinforcement Learning agents and enable fast experimentation.

This plugin comes with 2 recipes and one webapp template:

- Train the agent (Recipe)
- Test the agent (Recipe)
- Visualize the agent testing results (Webapp template)
